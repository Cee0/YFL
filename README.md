# Conexus ðŸ”—
~ A simple Discord bot to link voice channels to private text channels.

## Uses
- Provides a place for messages only pertaining to the people in a voice-channel (so you don't clutter #general or some place and confuse people)
- Allows people in voice-channels who cannot use voice to talk to the other people in a voice-channel without cluttering another text-channel
- Tracks people entering/leaving voice-channels
- Allows customization of associated channel names

This bot creates a hidden text-channel named `voice-channel` for every non-AFK voice channel on a server. Only users in a voice-channel can view and message in a hidden text-channel. 

## Commands
- `!conexus "new-default-name"` Set's the default name for created text-channels
- `!rename "new-name"` Set's the name of **one** associated text-channel (you must use the command in that channel)
